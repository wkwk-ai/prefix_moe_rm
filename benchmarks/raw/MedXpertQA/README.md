## 📖Overview

**MedXpertQA** includes 4,460 questions spanning 17 specialties and 11 body systems. It includes two subsets, **MedXpertQA Text** for text medical evaluation and **MedXpertQA MM** for multimodal medical evaluation. The following figure presents an overview.

## ✨Features

- **Next-Generation Multimodal Medical Evaluation:** MedXpertQA MM introduces expert-level medical exam questions with diverse images and rich clinical information, including patient records and examination results, setting it apart from traditional medical multimodal benchmarks with simple QA pairs generated from image captions.
- **Highly Challenging:** MedXpertQA introduces high-difficulty medical exam questions and applies rigorous filtering and augmentation, effectively addressing the insufficient difficulty of existing benchmarks like MedQA. The Text and MM subsets are currently the most challenging benchmarks in their respective fields.
- **Clinical Relevance:**  MedXpertQA incorporates specialty board questions to improve clinical relevance and comprehensiveness by collecting questions corresponding to 17/25 member board exams (specialties) of the American Board of Medical Specialties. It showcases remarkable diversity across multiple dimensions.

- **Mitigating Data Leakage:** We perform data synthesis to mitigate data leakage risk and conduct multiple rounds of expert reviews to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Reasoning-Oriented Evaluation:** Medicine provides a rich and representative setting for assessing reasoning abilities beyond mathematics and code. We develop a reasoning-oriented subset to facilitate the assessment of o1-like models.

## 📊Leaderboard

We evaluate 17 leading proprietary and open-source LMMs and LLMs including advanced inference-time scaled models with a focus on the latest progress in medical reasoning capabilities.
**Further details are available in the [leaderboard](https://medxpertqa.github.io) and the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18362).**

## 🔧Usage

1. Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/MedXpertQA
cd MedXpertQA/eval
```

2. Install Dependencies:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Inference:

```
bash scripts/run.sh
```

> The *run.sh* script performs inference by calling *main.py*, which offers additional features such as multithreading. Additionally, you can modify *model/api_agent.py* to support more models.

4. Evaluation:

We provide a script *eval.ipynb* to calculate accuracy on each subset.

> [!NOTE]
> Please use this script when evaluating the **QVQ** and **DeepSeek-R1**. Through case studies, we found that the answer cleaning function in the *utils.py* is unsuitable for these two models.
